# Overview

This is a web application made with react JavaScript. It is a basic version of the game connect 4 but you can undo, or redo moves you made.

I wanted to experiment with web applications and see if I could make a web game.

# Web Pages

The page dynamically creates the board, the undo buttons, the X or Os, and whoâ€™s turn it is or the winner.

# Development Environment

I made this in visual studio code and used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the react library of JavaScript.

# Useful Websites

* [React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
* [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/react/)

# Future Work

* I want to make win tracker, so that if you start over it keeps track of who has won each game.
* I want to add another row to match the official board size.
* I think it would be cool to add some sort of effect when someone wins.



#Below is an auto generated readme that was generated with how I started this project. It goes more in depth on how to run a react web application.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
